What is Astropy?
----------------

The Astropy project is a common effort to develop a single core package for
Astronomy that brings together almost 100 developers from around the world.

Development is actively ongoing, with major packages such as `PyFITS`_,
`PyWCS`_, `vo`_, and `asciitable`_ already merged in, and many more components
being worked on. In particular, we are developing imaging, photometric, and
spectroscopic functionality, as well as frameworks for cosmology, unit
handling, and coordinate transformations. 

The current stable version is |currentstable|_.

Stay updated by following `@astropy <http://twitter.com/#!/astropy>`_ on Twitter, or sign up to the `astropy`_ mailing list!

If you are interested in finding out more about the Astropy project, you can read the :doc:`original vision <vision>` for the package.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the `astropy` core package is available at the
websites listed below. The first is for the most recent released
version.  The second is for a version of the documentation that is 
automatically updated any time a change is made to the 
`astropy source code repository <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

* `Stable version (docs.astropy.org) <http://docs.astropy.org>`_
* `Latest developer version <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ 
    


Installing
----------

Detailed installation instructions are provided in the `documentation`_, but
we have included a simplified version here.

Astropy requires `Python`_ 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, or 3.2, and `Numpy`_ 1.4 or later. The 
best way to install astropy is to use `pip`_::

    pip install astropy
    
Or alternatively, you can download the source from the current version (|currentstable|_),
and install the source code in that archive using::

    python setup.py install

You can check that astropy is correctly installed by starting up ``python`` or ``ipython``, and importing ``astropy``::

    >>> import astropy

If you do not get any errors, the installation was successful!

.. note::

    If you want to install the latest *developer* version of Astropy, use::

        git clone http://github.com/astropy/astropy.git
        cd astropy
        python setup.py install

Getting help
------------

If you want to discuss issues with other Astropy users and with the
developers, you can sign up to the `astropy`_ mailing list!

Reporting issues
----------------

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker`_, and we will look into it promptly!
